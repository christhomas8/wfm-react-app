# Work Force Management App

This project was built in React as a software demonstration for call centers.<br>
It includes a login page that requires the correct input to load the main app page.

If the login is successful, the signed in version of the main app will appear.

The main app includes the following components:
1) A randomly generated schedule of the day with the current date and load time displayed
2) A telephone that dials numbers from the pressed buttons with the option to call the number, end the call, or delete input
3) Company News with an article image, a paragraph preview, a link to full articles, and some personalization
4) A notepad that allows notes to be recorded and displayed in a historical fashion
5) Header personalization to display who the current account is signed in as
6) Theme settings for toggling between the light and dark themes of the UI
7) A sign out option to return to the login page and sign into another account



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It was developed by using `nvm install 14.19.0` but should work with other versions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
